#  Receipt Processing Application

Takes in a JSON receipt and return a JSON object with an ID generated by your code.

The ID returned is the ID that should be passed into /receipts/{id}/points to get the number of points the receipt was awarded.

These rules collectively define how many points should be awarded to a receipt.

One point for every alphanumeric character in the retailer name.
50 points if the total is a round dollar amount with no cents.
25 points if the total is a multiple of 0.25.
5 points for every two items on the receipt.
If the trimmed length of the item description is a multiple of 3, multiply the price by 0.2 and round up to the nearest integer. The result is the number of points earned.
6 points if the day in the purchase date is odd.
10 points if the time of purchase is after 2:00pm and before 4:00pm.
